          Virifi.io serves as the foundational digital infrastructure supporting
          our strategic solutions across various business domains. With its
          robust technology, Virifi.io underpins a wide range of applications in
          FinTech, HR, EdTech, and eGovernment. Virifi is the utilization of a
          private and secure blockchain network. This network enables the
          storage, retrieval, and validation of critical data in a safe and
          tamper-proof manner. The secure exchange of information between Virifi
          and other entities is governed by channel-level security protocols and
          authentication mechanisms. It leverages a cloud-native Hyperledger
          platform. This cloud-based approach enhances scalability, flexibility,
          and accessibility, empowering the private Virifi Blockchain to deliver
          optimal performance and reliability. To ensure seamless integration,
          Virifi was designed with a focus on API development. The APIs were
          built as a primary component, allowing easy and controlled access to
          the Virifi platform through a fully managed API gateway. This gateway
          enables granular control over access and usage, providing users with
          minute-level management capabilities. It offers robust identity
          verification capabilities and supports e-KYC (electronic Know Your
          Customer) processes.
