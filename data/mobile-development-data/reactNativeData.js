      Yes, it is possible to migrate the existing mobile apps to React Native. Developers can easily re-develop parts or all of an app using React Native’s single codebase feature for both <Link className="text-blue-500" href={"https://braininventory.in/mobile-development/ios-app-development-company"}>iOS</Link> and <Link className="text-blue-500" href={"https://braininventory.in/mobile-development/android-app-development-company"}>Android platforms</Link>. This potentially reduces the development time and extra costs that otherwise are needed for app migration.
