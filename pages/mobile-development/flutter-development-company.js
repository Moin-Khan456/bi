        "Flutter is a cross-platform app development framework from Google that allows developers to write their native iOS and Android applications in Dart. Flutter is already popular amongst developers due to its rapid expansion. Brands who have used Flutter for their apps usually have a high demand for Flutter developers because app compatibility with Fuchsia OS can be achieved by sticking to the Dart programming language and using the Dart VM on Android or Fuchsia OS.",

        "To determine the cost of developing a Flutter app, there are several factors to consider. It is best to ask your potential developer what they will charge before reaching out to them. If you have a clear vision for your app, it should be easy to share this with developers who can help you realize your ideas. A developer that specializes in Flutter applications can help you focus on more important things than just how much time you’ll need for development.",

        "Choosing a backend technology is crucial for any project. This choice will depend on many factors such as existing technologies used by the front end. If you have an existing application with some backend code, it would be easier to hook a Flutter app to it so that it can reuse its code base. However, if you need additional features and calculations much more strongly than basic REST APIs usually handled by separate batches of operations, then you’ll have to integrate into a new backend service(s).",
