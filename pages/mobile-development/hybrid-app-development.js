The hybrid application development process involves using a single unified framework like PhoneGap or Ionic. This method works well because the frameworks use native platform capabilities and programming languages (JavaScript in most cases) to develop the hybrid apps which means it can be used to target multiple platforms like Android, iOS, Windows, Unity.
