Additionally, when compared to JavaScript, Angular takes less time to develop and launch an app. This means that you can have a working prototype of your idea up and running in as little as a few days. In a nutshell, the framework offers code reusability and well-structured architecture. We will guide you through the process of developing a customized web or mobile application quickly, efficiently, and without the need to worry about things that are not really important for a successful project outcome.",

Its popularity is well-deserved; it offers a wide variety of features and makes user interaction with the website much smoother. However, one shortcoming of Angular.js is its inability to seamlessly communicate with back-end servers.
